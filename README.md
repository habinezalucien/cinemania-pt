## Case Study

Cinemania is a community of Cinema enthusiasts. This community needs a web application that would allow to manage different members. Your task is a to develop this application using Django framework.
This application should:
- Allow members to signup and provide their basic information (first name, last name, gender, age, and a profile image, registration date)
- provide a way for registered members to log in.
- provide for logged in members, a way see to latest favorite movies from other members.
- Allow each member to add their favorite movies. Movies should be identified by title, release date, main actors, genre(action, comedy,...), synopsis or description, movie poster (if available) and movie trailer link/url (if available), the member or user who has added it and when it's been added.
- Have a custom look and feel (style it however you like)

It would be nice if the application provides a way to categories movies by their genres. In addition to that, a search option would be a really nice option.<br>

Deploy your app to any deployment platform of your choice. (check resources below)
Feel free to add any other features you deem necessary within the time given.

PS: I need to see commits from all members of the project team.
